			</br>
			<p class="supplement">•	Processing any online donations you make to Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Harlem: When you donate to honor someone else, we do not use the information you give us about that person for any other purpose.</p>

			</br>
			<p class="supplement">"Cookies" may be used in connection with this site.
